DNS DSL
=======

**This library provides an intuitive DSL for DNS management in Kotlin & Java**

**Heads Up:** *DNS as a protocol is not actually implemented, so this will not serve as a DNS server or client. However, 
if you're looking for a library that is capable of representing and abstracting over zones, records and different 
specific concepts from DNS, this is for you.*
